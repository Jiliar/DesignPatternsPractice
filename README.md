# Java Design Patterns Project üõ†Ô∏èüê±‚Äçüë§

Welcome to the Java Design Patterns project! This project demonstrates the implementation of classic design patterns, as described in the "Gang of Four" book. These patterns are categorized into **Creational**, **Structural**, and **Behavioral** patterns, each providing a unique approach to solving common software design challenges. üöÄ

## Types of Patterns

### 1. Creational Patterns üå±
Creational patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, optimizing flexibility and reuse of existing code.

- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it.
- **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating an object, allowing subclasses to alter the type of object that will be created.
- **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Builder**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
- **Prototype**: Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.

### 2. Structural Patterns üß±
Structural patterns deal with object composition, helping ensure that if one part changes, the entire structure won‚Äôt need drastic changes.

- **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by acting as a bridge.
- **Bridge**: Separates an object's abstraction from its implementation, allowing both to vary independently.
- **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
- **Decorator**: Adds new responsibilities to objects dynamically and transparently, without affecting other objects.
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex system.
- **Flyweight**: Reduces memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with other similar objects.
- **Proxy**: Controls access to another object, usually to add a layer of security or optimization.

### 3. Behavioral Patterns ü§π‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Behavioral patterns define the communication between objects, making the interaction flexible and easier to understand.

- **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes a request along a chain of handlers until it's handled.
- **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization of clients with different requests.
- **Interpreter**: Implements a specialized language or grammar.
- **Iterator**: Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially, without exposing its underlying structure.
- **Mediator**: Defines an object that controls the interaction between a group of objects.
- **Memento**: Allows capturing and restoring an object‚Äôs state.
- **Observer**: Defines a dependency between objects so that when one changes, others are notified.
- **State**: Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.
- **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one and allowing them to be interchangeable.
- **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass, allowing subclasses to override specific steps.
- **Visitor**: Allows adding new operations to classes without modifying them.
